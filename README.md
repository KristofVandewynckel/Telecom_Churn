## Project  description:
**In this project we are predicticting the customer churn rate - the percentage of customers who either cancel or don't renew their subscription. It is an important measure that can help businesses to retain their clients.**
    
* <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn"><strong>Data source </strong></a> - This Kaggle dataset tracks a telco company's customer churn based on a variety of possible factors.
    * **Target** value is churn - it indicates whether or not the customer left within the last month
    * **Features** include: customerID, gender, SeniorCitizen, Partner, Dependents, tenure, PhoneService, MultipleLines, InternetService, OnlineSecurity, OnlineBackup, DeviceProtection, TechSupport, StreamingTV, StreamingMovies, Contract, PaperlessBilling, PaymentMethod, MonthlyCharges, TotalCharges
   
## Steps of the project: 
* Exploring and pre-processing the data 
* Visualising 
* Comparing performance of various ML models
* Fine tuning the best performing models
* Looking for clusters in the data
* Interpreting the results
* Creating a dashboard in Power BI
